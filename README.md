# Data-Visualization-
The Sales Data Analysis project is a complete, beginner-to-intermediate level data analytics project that demonstrates how raw sales data can be processed, cleaned, analyzed, and transformed into meaningful business insights using Python. The project focuses on working with structured CSV data and follows a real-world data analysis workflow commonly used in business and analytics environments.
Using the pandas library, the project loads a sales dataset, explores its structure, handles missing values, and removes duplicate records to ensure data quality. Key sales performance metrics such as total revenue, average sales per transaction, total quantity sold, and best-selling product are calculated using aggregation and grouping operations.

To enhance analytical understanding, the project also includes data visualizations created with matplotlib, such as a bar chart showing product-wise revenue and a line chart representing sales trends. These visualizations help convert numerical data into clear, interpretable insights that support data-driven decision-making.

This project emphasizes clean coding practices, error handling, and professional documentation, making it suitable for data analytics internships, academic evaluations, and beginner portfolios. It provides hands-on experience with essential data analysis concepts and serves as a strong foundation for advanced topics like dashboards, automation, and machine learning.
